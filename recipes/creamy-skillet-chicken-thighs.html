        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1.5 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>1/3 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and cut into strips</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Set an oven-proof skillet on high heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon oil and chicken. Cook until well seared, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate and reduce heat to medium.</li>
                <li>Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil, then add garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Bloom spices together for 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth, then add sun-dried tomatoes, and finally the cream. Stir well and then blend in Parmesan cheese. Bring to a light simmer. Add chicken back to the pan.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the preheated oven and bake, uncovered, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly to let the sauce thicken before serving, about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
